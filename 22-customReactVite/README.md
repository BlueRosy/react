# this is to illustrate how react work !!
how react create a virtual DOM and render element in the DOM.

three ways:
1. function-based component (in which the function will return a html element)

2. define const var = a html element. and render this var in the virtual DOM 

3. the original object will be converted to a react object through react language (createElement), then render this element in the virtual DOM
