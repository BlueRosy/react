# class 2: create my react namecard component
namecard: a picture, a card Title, a description paragraph

.jsx file:
1. need to import a css style sheet.
2. if we need to use a image, we need  to place the image in the assets folder and then import the image through relative path
3. in react, class is a reserved keyword, so we must change to use className=
4. to quote sth. {name} without "". e.g: src={image}

.css
1. a card could be display: inline-block;
2. to the best, a card width: 250px;
